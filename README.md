# MADLIBS
The game you all know and love. As a user, Madlibs allows you to both create new Madlib stories using a tagging system for extracting and labelling words as well as play a particular Madlibs story.

When playing users can only see the form generated by the extracted words and not the story itself, giving users that real Madlibs feel. When they've submitted their form they'll be able to read the generated story and rate it for others.

The goal of this project was to create a web application using only Ruby on Rails and without incorporating a seperate frontend framework. The application has authentication implemented using the bcrypt gem.

In development, I used D3.js to create a bubble chart of user created categories, Filestack to host the user images, bcrypt for authentication, and EventfulAPI to pull in events from a user's hometown.
