MadLibs
===============
MadLibs allows users to both create new MadLib stories using a tagging system for extracting and labelling words as well as play a particular MadLibs story or read other users completed MadLibs stories. When playing users can only see the form generated by the extracted words and not the story itself, giving users that real Madlibs feel. When they've submitted their form they'll be able to read the generated story and rate it for others.
