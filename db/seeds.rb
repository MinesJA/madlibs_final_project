granny_opens_fire = "An #number_less_than_a_hundred year-old #adjective_1 woman got so fed up with her #adjective_2 neighbors, she opened fire on them, #plural_noun_1 say. The California woman has been arrested after shooting at a family of five, three of them #plural_noun_2, according to the #possessive_noun_1 Office.

When police arrived, a neighbor identified as #persons_name_1, spoke to authorities and said that she was outside her home on the front yard with her husband and three kids, when her elderly neighbors started to become upset at their kids.

Authorities said 84-year-old Betty Frances Sanders and her husband then approached the family at their front yard fence and complained about the children riding motorcycles and being noisy. Moments later an argument broke out and Sanders fired one round from a handgun toward Rollins and her family, who were approximately 20 feet away."
