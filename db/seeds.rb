He used her credit cards to buy nearly $400 worth of #plural_noun_1# and #plural_noun_2#. The suspect grabbed the wallet when the victim placed it on the #adjective_2# counter of the Forest Avenue Dunkin Donuts at 10 p.m. The next day, he made the rounds of #place_1 and #place_2 where he used her credit cards to buy #noun_3 and #noun_4#, according to #persons_name_1#.

# When they arrived, a neighbor identified as #person#, said that she was outside #location# with her husband and three kids. #number_less_than_a_hundred#-year-old Betty Frances Sanders and her husband approached the family and complained that the children were riding #noun_2# and being #adjective#.

# pistol_packing_granny = "A Texas grandma was not about to go down without a fight. Rebbie Roberson, 74, was just about to watch the news Sunday night when someone wearing gloves and a mask broke into her home.
# The intruder pointed a gun right at her face. What she did next took the gunman by surprise. She had her own weapon on a table nearby. She reached over, grabbed this gun, swerved around and I pointed it at him. He ran away with Roberson following him.  All the while, firing her .38-caliber pistol and leaving bullet holes in the walls of her home. Roberson was not sure if she had hit the gunman but she deffintely tried and was hoping that she did.  Investigators do not believe the armed intruder was wounded. While at home, Roberson likes to keep her gun close. This was the first and, hopefully, the last time she will ever have to use it."

In 1769 he was elected president of the United States.  His #adjective_2# life and #adjective_3# legacy of scientific and political achievement, and his status as one of #place_1# most influential Founding Fathers, have seen Franklin honored more than two centuries after his death, with his face shown on #noun_4# and the #noun_5#."

# donald_trump = "Donald Trump has many serious flaws, including incorrigible #a_negative_flaw_1#, rampant #a_negative_flaw_2#, and contempt for #noun_1#. BUT nothing compares to his most prominent, #adjective_1# and incurable defect: He’s dimmer than a 5-watt bulb! Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was reported to have called the president a “#insult_word_1#”. The late William T. Kelley, who taught Trump at the University of Pennsylvania, said, 'Donald Trump was the #adjective_ending_with_'est'_2# goddamn student I ever had.' Tony Schwartz, the ghostwriter for 'The Art of the Deal,' says Trump had 'a #adjective_3# level of superficial knowledge and #adjective_4# ignorance.' Trump’s feeble-mindedness is on daily view through his twitter account. His tweets are studded with misspellings, random capitalizations and mystifying quotation marks. Trump relies on a #noun_3# the size of a second-grader’s for his inspiration. To combat #noun_4# abuse among teens, he says, ‘No good, really bad for you in every way.' Those #noun_6# he tossed to a crowd in Puerto Rico were 'very good #noun_6#.' He wanted to call the #noun_7# reform bill 'The Cut Cut Cut Act.' Trump tries to conceal his intellectual deficiency by insisting how smart he is. 'I went to a #place_1#,' he said last month. 'I’m a very intelligent person.' He has to make such claims because all the evidence indicates his cranium contains #something_gross#."

# office_and_sex = "A study published in the #Magazine_Or_Periodical# has found evidence that sex might have a #Adjective_1# impact on your job. For #duration_of_time#, a study was conducted that asked #number# married, full-time–employed #Plural_Noun# to complete three daily surveys in the morning, afternoon, and night. The survey’s questions asked about their sexual activity the night before and their current mood and productivity at work. The results showed that the day after #Plural_Noun# reported having sex, they were not only in a better mood at work but also had a higher sense of satisfaction and job engagement. The study also found a correlation to support an inverse finding: Being stressed or unhappy at work meant participants were less likely to have sex that day. It might be worth a little experimenting to see for yourself whether your work game improves following sex."

# hypnosis_for_sleep = "Getting quality sleep isn’t easy. Waking up feeling #Adjective_1# refreshed is basically like winning a gold #noun_1#. That’s exactly why when #Person# wasn’t catching enough zzz’s, they decided to give hypnosis a try.  Believe it or not, hypnosis isn’t just a way to get people to embarrass themselves onstage by showing off their #Adjective_2# dance moves or howling like a #Animal#. The #Adjective_3# ritual  puts you in a trance-like state that makes you more open to #Plural_Noun_1#. Hypnosis actually offers plenty of benefits, such as reducing #Plural_Nouns_2#, helping with #noun_2#, or even getting rid of #Plural_Nouns_3#. For #Person#, hypnosis has led to some of the best sleep of their life."

The suspect grabbed the wallet when the victim placed it on the wicked counter of the Forest Avenue Dunkin Donuts at 10 p.m. The next day, he made the rounds of Disney Land and Chuckee Cheese where he used her credit cards to buy hot dogs and Teslas, according to Mike Meyers.
